\section{Data}

The dataset used in this shared task is the IBM Debater(R) - ArgKP v1 \cite{bar2020arguments} which consists of over 
24.000 argument and key point pairs labeled as matching/non-matching.
They all belong to one of 28 controversial topics ranging from "Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence." to 
"We should abandon marriage." therefore drawing a clear line between supporting and non-supporting key points.

The section used for training has over 5500 arguments belonging to over 200 key points with 24 topics. This leaves the 
dev dataset with over 900 arguments and 36 key points for 4 topics.
