\section{Data}\label{data}

The dataset used in this shared task is the IBM Debater(R) - ArgKP v1 \cite{Bar-HaimEFKLS2020} which consists of over 
24.000 argument and key point pairs labeled as matching/non-matching.
They all belong to one of 28 controversial topics ranging from "Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence." to 
"We should abandon marriage." therefore drawing a clear line between supporting and non-supporting key points.

The section used for training has over 5500 arguments belonging to over 200 key points with 24 topics. This leaves the 
dev dataset with over 900 arguments and 36 key points for 4 topics.

\subsection{Characteristics}

\todo{Report data characteristics from exploratory data analysis.}
When analyzing the data, we realize that matched and unmatched key points of a given argument contain a certain proportion of the same words. Many of these words belong to the set of stop words. These uninformative, non-decisive words can complicate the decision process between the matched and unmatched keypoint. For this reason, we remove stop words from our data during pre-processing. Furthermore, the important words from the argument are repeated with different tenses and parts of speech in key points, for example: \textit{legalize, legalized, legalizing, legal} or \textit{marriages, marriage}. Because these words were used again, they can play a role in classification. To achieve an unambiguous spelling, such words are normalized with a stemming method in our approach. Moreover, this conversion to the word root reduces the size of the vocabulary or the dimensions of the text input. With a low number of dimensions, the assumption of independence of individual features in general machine learning algorithms is violated with a low probability. It is still recognized that context understanding can be a challenge for the task. For the topic \textit{We should abandon the use of school uniform} we have an argument: \textit{it is not fair to not allow children to express their personality through dress as long as it is appropriate}. A key point for the argument is \textit{School uniform is harming the student's self-expression}. We can first see that the two sentences have little in common. To predict if the key point is aligned with the argument, we need to compare the meaning of the sentences. One approach to this challenge in NLP is to apply the language model, which we describe in ... describe in detail.
