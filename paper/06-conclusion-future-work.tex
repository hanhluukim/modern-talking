\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{conclusion}

\todo{Conclude findings in this paper.}

This work deals with a practical problem that a large set of arguments can be summarized automatically by short key points.

Although the baseline approach is a simple idea, the approach has achieved the mAP of 50\%. 
The baseline approach is straightforward to implement but cannot eliminate the problem of context understanding. 
\Roberta and \Bert have achieved good performance, because they can capture the context understanding challenge. 
\Roberta 's model also performed better than BERT in this task, especially for the long arguments???. This point again showed the importance of architecture, training objectives, and hyperparameter selection \todo{only draft}.
\subsection{Future Work}

\todo{Highlight some interesting directions of future research.}
