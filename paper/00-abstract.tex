In this paper, we present our two approaches for Track 1 Key Point Matching of the common Quantitative Summarization - Key Point Analysis task. 

Our two approaches use two methods to determine whether a Key Point matches an argument under the given topic: Jaccard coefficients and binary classification using a fine-tuned language model \Roberta. We also applied several classical preprocessing methods from the field of natural language processing to preprocess our input text data, such as stop words, lemmatization, and application of the WordNet lexical database.

With our approaches, we got the best score ... of all participants in the Shared Task Track 1 Key Point Matching.
